# JDBC-API
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) provides Java developers with a standard API that is used to access databases, regardless of the driver and database product.
JDBC presents a uniform interface to databases which created on the DBMS project - change vendors and your applications only need to change their driver.
It supports the following SQL Statements:
o Create database
o Create table
o Insert into table
o Delete from table
o Drop database
o Drop table
o Select from table
o Update table
o Union tables
o Alter table
o Select Distinct
o OrderBy
o Save with xml or JSON
o Date and Float Types
